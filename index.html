    <p2> Dan Reeder at fifty years old released his first album, self titled. Reeder is a no nonsence narrarator, with a Bukowski esque tell it-as-it-is vulgar narraration which remains prevelant in all of his work. He has a way of pointing out lifes inconsistancies whilst ensuring the listeners comfort with his gentle crooner vocals and dry sense of humor. Work Song for example is a Kafka esque story about having “all of the fuckin’ I need” - the only lyrics of the song, conveying the message of workplace fatgue using relatable humorus apathy without having to tell an elaborate story. And this apathy undlies all of his songs, singing about human needs, with a primal will to survive in the modern setting. Food and Pussy is one of the greatest illustrations of these themes as he sings about wanting eat, and have sex because “it’s the way God made [him]/ [he] [guesses] it must be okay”, while in the B section of the song, working in a “little monkeys jumping on the bed” enterpelation resulting in telling the doctor of the songs motif . The most popular song Clean Elvis, manages to incorporate Dolly Parton’s I will always love you  and Elvis’ I cant help falling in love with you, while subverting expectations during every line on the verses, a testament to how little Dan Reeder cares. It is important to understand his self sufficiency to understand dan reeder, everything from production to album art to the crafting of each instrument, and the recording devices and digital audio workstation used on his album is done by the man himself.</p2>
